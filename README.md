# openclaw-crm

Lightweight CRM pipeline tracker backed by Google Sheets. Built for small agencies and solo operators who want pipeline visibility without paying for Salesforce.

## Features

- **Pipeline CRUD** — add, update, move deals through stages (lead → qualifying → proposal → negotiation → won/lost)
- **Spider Network** — track referral chains between clients. When Client A mentions Company B has a problem you can solve, the relationship chain is preserved
- **Stale Deal Alerts** — configurable thresholds (7/14/21 day buckets) for deals going cold
- **Weighted Pipeline Value** — probability-weighted revenue forecasting by stage
- **Network Signals** — queue and triage referral signals before promoting to deals
- **Competitor Guard** — prevents selling to a client's competitor through their own network
- **Overdue Invoice Tracking** — flags invoices older than 30 days
- **Pluggable Sheets Backend** — ships with `gws` CLI backend, swap in `gspread` or direct API

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install openclaw-crm

# Option 1: Config file
echo 'google:
  crm_spreadsheet_id: "YOUR_SHEET_ID"' > crm.yaml

# Option 2: Environment variable
export CRM_SPREADSHEET_ID="YOUR_SHEET_ID"

# Run

openclaw-crm move '{"client": "Acme", "stage": "proposal"}'
openclaw-crm stale
openclaw-crm network
```

## Spreadsheet Setup

Create a Google Sheet with two tabs:

### Pipeline (21 columns, A:U)

| Col | Header | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| A | Client | Company name |
| B | Contact | Person name |
| C | Source | upwork, network, inbound, etc. |

| E | Budget | Dollar amount |
| F | Rate Type | fixed, hourly, retainer |
| G | Service | What you're selling |
| H | First Contact | YYYY-MM-DD |
| I | Last Contact | YYYY-MM-DD |
| J | Next Action | What to do next |
| K | Due Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| L | Notes | Free text |
| M | Slack Channel | Channel ID |
| N | Proposal Link | URL |
| O | Owner | Team member |
| P | Upwork URL | Job listing URL |
| Q | Probability | `=IFS(D2="lead",0.1,...)` formula |
| R | Referred By | Which client referred this lead |
| S | Network Parent | Parent in referral tree |
| T | Network Notes | Context about the referral |
| U | Signal Date | YYYY-MM-DD |

### Network Signals (6 columns, A:F)

| Col | Header |
|-----|--------|
| A | Timestamp |
| B | Source Client |
| C | Channel |
| D | Signal Text |
| E | Mentioned Company |
| F | Status (new/promoted/dismissed) |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `summary` | Pipeline overview with weighted value |
| `stale` | Deals with no contact in 7+ days |
| `overdue` | Invoices older than 30 days |
| `add` | Create a new deal |
| `move` | Move deal to new stage |
| `network` | Show referral tree |
| `signals` | List pending network signals |
| `promote` | Promote signal to pipeline deal |
| `dismiss` | Dismiss a signal |
| `record-signal` | Record a new network signal |

All commands output JSON: `{"ok": true, "text": "formatted message", "data": {...}}`

## Google Sheets Backend

By default, openclaw-crm uses the [`gws` CLI](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/gws) for Google Sheets access. Install it and authenticate:

```bash
# Install gws
go install github.com/nicholasgasior/gws@latest

# Authenticate
gws auth login
```

### Using Gspread Backend

Instead of the `gws` CLI, you can use the built-in gspread backend:

```bash
pip install openclaw-crm[gspread]
```

```python
from openclaw_crm.backends import GspreadBackend, set_backend

# Using service account file
set_backend(GspreadBackend("service-account.json"))

# Or using default OAuth credentials
set_backend(GspreadBackend())
```

### Custom Backend

Implement the `SheetsBackend` interface to use any Google Sheets library:

```python
from openclaw_crm.sheets import SheetsBackend, SheetResult, set_backend

class GspreadBackend(SheetsBackend):
    def __init__(self, credentials_path):
        import gspread
        self.gc = gspread.service_account(filename=credentials_path)

    def read(self, spreadsheet_id, range_):
        sh = self.gc.open_by_key(spreadsheet_id)
        worksheet = sh.worksheet(range_.split("!")[0].strip("'"))
        return SheetResult(success=True, data={"values": worksheet.get_all_values()})

    def append(self, spreadsheet_id, range_, values):
        # ...implement
        pass

    def update(self, spreadsheet_id, range_, values):
        # ...implement
        pass

set_backend(GspreadBackend("credentials.json"))
```
